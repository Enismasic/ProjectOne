    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>

       I enjoy playing video games with my friends and family in my spare time.

       I have been playing video games for as long as I can remeber and what ultimately got me into gaming

      Activities:  
      I enjoy going to the gym and playing soccer. Soccer has always been my favorite sport. What got me into the sport was my dad. My dad was once a soccer player in Bosnia before he had to flee the country because of the war. When I was younger everyday after school I would go to a park where I would go practice my fundamentals with my dad. 
      I generally go to the gym four to six times each week. I love going to the gym because I love pushing myself and making my body stronger everyday.
      </li>

   <li>Travel & Hiking: 
    I also love to travel the world and hike. I have traveled to countries like Japan, Mexico, Bosnia, and Croatia. I also love to hike all the time with friends and family.
    I've hiked in places such as Japan, Arizona, Colorado, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.
